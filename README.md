# DMO-structure

Interactive React + Three.js visualization for Jahn-Teller distortion in Mn³⁺ octahedra.

## Added component
- `RobustJTVisualizer.jsx`: combines
  - real-space MnO₆ distortion (3D)
  - orbital-energy splitting (2D)
  - shared physical parameters (`Q3`, coupling `λ`, stabilization energy `ΔE`)

## Notes
This repository currently stores the core component file only; integrate it into your React app entrypoint as needed.
